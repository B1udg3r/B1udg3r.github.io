I am a security consultant and penetration tester specialising in infrastructure, web applications, and novel network protocols.

This site acts as a technical archive for my personal research. My work primarily focuses on radio frequency protocols, such as Long Range (LoRa), the Offline Finding (OF) mesh network, and logic flaws in complex systems.

I document my findings here to ensure knowledge is shared and reproducible.
